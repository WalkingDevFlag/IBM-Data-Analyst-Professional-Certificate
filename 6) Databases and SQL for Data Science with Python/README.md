## About this Course
This course introduces the learner to databases and SQL before advancing to the methods required to access databases using Python in Jupyter Notebook.

The course has five modules:
-	Getting Started with SQL
-	Introduction to Relational Databases and Tables
-	Intermediate SQL
-	Accessing Databases using Python
-	Course Assignment

This was an essential course for me as it taught me SQL, an invaluable tool for Data Analysts.

Some of the concepts taught in the course:
-	Basic SQL
-	CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE
-	Sorting and Grouping
-	Sub-Queries
-	Accessing Databases with SQL Magic
  
The course assignment was based on real life crime data from the United States. We were instructed to load the given datasets in Python before writing queries as per the questions given. We were then quizzed on the answer we had gotten based on the queries we had written. I scored full marks on the quiz.

The Jupyter Notebook file with the queries is provided in this folder.
