## About this Course
Having learnt the basics of Python earlier in the program, this course focuses on teaching the learner the procedure of using Python specifically for data analysis and model development.

The course has six modules:
-	Importing Data Sets
-	Data Wrangling
-	Exploratory Data Analysis
-	Model Development
-	Model Evaluation and Refinement
-	Final Assignment

I have always enjoyed coding in Python so this was a fun course where I learnt new methods of analyzing data using Python.

Some of the concepts taught in the course:
-	Importing data sets
-	Data wrangling with Python
-	Exploratory Data Analysis
-	Regressions and Model Development
-	Model Evaluation and Refinement

As the final course project, we were given a dataset containing house sale prices and information on the respective houses. Using the dataset, we were tasked with building and refining a model predicting the market price of a house given its set of features. It was a fun project utilising regressions and standard data analysis procedures like data wrangling and exploratory data analysis.
The completed Jupyter Notebook file is provided in this folder.
