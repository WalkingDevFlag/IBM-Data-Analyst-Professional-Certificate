In this lesson, you have learned the following information: 

Statistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of numerical or quantitative data. 

Statistical Analysis involves the use of statistical methods in order to develop an understanding of what the data represents. 

Statistical Analysis can be:

Descriptive; that which provides a summary of what the data represents. Common measures include Central Tendency, Dispersion, and Skewness.

Inferential; that which involves making inferences, or generalizations, about data. Common measures include Hypothesis Testing, Confidence Intervals, and Regression Analysis.

Data Mining, simply put, is the process of extracting knowledge from data. It involves the use of pattern recognition technologies, statistical analysis, and mathematical techniques, in order to identify correlations, patterns, variations, and trends in data. 

There are several techniques that can help mine data, such as, classifying attributes of data, clustering data into groups, establishing relationships between events, variables, and input and output.  

A variety of software and tools are available for analyzing and mining data. Some of the popularly used ones include Spreadsheets, R-Language, Python, IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM Watson Studio, and SAS, each with their own set of characteristics, strengths, limitations, and applications.
