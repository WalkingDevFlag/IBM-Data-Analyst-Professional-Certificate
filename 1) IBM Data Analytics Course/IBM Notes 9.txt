Data visualization is the discipline of communicating information through the use of visual elements such as graphs, charts, and maps. The goal of visualizing data is to make information easy to comprehend, interpret, and retain. 

For data visualization to be of value, you need to:

Think about the key takeaway for your audience.

Anticipate their information needs and questions, and then plan the visualization that delivers your message clearly and impactfully.

There are several types of graphs and charts available for you to be able to plot any kind of data, such as bar charts, column charts, pie charts, and line charts. 

You can also use data visualization to build dashboards. Dashboards organize and display reports and visualizations coming from multiple data sources into a single graphical interface. They are easy to comprehend and allow you to generate reports on the go.
