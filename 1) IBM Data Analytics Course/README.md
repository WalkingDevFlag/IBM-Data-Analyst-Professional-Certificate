## About this Course
As the introductory course in the program, the course teaches the learner the role, skills and tools required, and the responsibilities of a Data Analyst.

The course has five modules: 
-	What is Data Analytics
-	The Data Ecosystem
-	Gathering and Wrangling Data
-	Mining and Visualizing Data and Communicating Results
-	Career Opportunities and Data Analysis in Action

This was an important course as it provided me the blueprint for becoming a Data Analyst. I was able to familiarize myself with the role and responsibilities of a Data Analyst while also being made aware of the skills and tools I would be required to know.

As the final course assignment, I was asked to analyse a table containing details on possible credit card fraud victims. I was then made to answer a set of questions based on whether I could determine the fraudulent transactions based on the anomalies that I could spot.
