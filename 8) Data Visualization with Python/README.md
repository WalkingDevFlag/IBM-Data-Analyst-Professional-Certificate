## About this Course
Following up on the previous course of analyzing data using Python, this course introduces data visualization using matplotlib, seaborn, folium. It also moves on to more challenging procedures of building dashboard apps using Dash and Plotly.

The course has five modules:
-	Introduction to Data Visualization Tools
-	Basic and Specialized Visualization Tools
-	Advanced Visualizations and Geospatial Data
-	Creating Dashboards with Plotly and Dash
-	Final Project and Exam

This was the most challenging course for me so far. While creating visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn are simple to grasp, it gets a bit confusing remembering all the attributes at times. Using folium for Geospatial data was a bit tricky but interesting to learn. Dashboards were tough but satisfying to complete.

Some of the concepts taught in the course:
-	Basic plots with matplotlib and seaborn
-	Folium and plotting Geospatial Data
-	Dashboards with Plotly and Dash

The final assessment was split into three parts. The first part was a straight forward visualization exercise using data based on automobile sales over the years. We were to plot different visualizations and make inferences related to recessions. 

For the second part, we were given a blueprint python code. We were tasked with filling in the major components to create a dashboard containing different visualizations on the automobile sales data. This was quite challenging and time consuming. Completing it was highly satisfying.

The final part was a test on all the concepts from the course in which I scored 80%, indicating that Python visualization something which I have to work on more.
The completed Jupyter Notebook file and Python file (for the dashboard) are provided in this folder.
