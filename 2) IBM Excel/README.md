## About this Course
This course goes over the basics of Microsoft Excel and equips the learner with the skills needed in Excel as a Data Analyst.

The course has five modules:
-	Introduction to Data Analysis Using Spreadsheets
-	Getting Started with Using Excel Spreadsheets
-	Cleaning and Wrangling Data Using Spreadsheets
-	Analyzing Data Using Spreadsheets
-	Final Project
  
Since I have been using Excel for the past few years, I was familiar with most of the concepts and formulas taught. However, it did prove to be a good refresher for all the Data Analyst specific skills in Excel.

Some of the concepts taught in the course:
-	Essential formulas for a Data Analyst
-	Importing data
-	Cleaning data
-	Filtering and sorting data
-	Pivot Tables
  
As the final course assignment, I was given a CSV file containing raw data. I was asked to clean the data and make required adjustments to certain texts in the file. The next step involved creating three pivot tables as per given instructions. 

The final Excel file which I submitted is provided in this folder.
