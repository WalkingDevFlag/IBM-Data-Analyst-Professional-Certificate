## About this Course
Python is one of the essential tools for a Data Analyst and this course starts with a beginnerâ€™s guide to the popular coding language before advancing to data analyst libraries such as Pandas and Numpy. 

The course has five modules:
-	Python Basics
-	Python Data Structures
-	Python Programming Fundamentals
-	Working with Data in Python

I have learnt Python in the past so this course was easy to follow. It served as a good refresher for the Pandas library and additionally it taught me web scraping using Python and about APIs.

Some of the concepts taught in the course:
-	Fundamentals of Python
-	Pandas
-	Numpy
-	APIs
-	Web scraping

Instead of a project, this course had a final quiz, in which I scored full marks.
