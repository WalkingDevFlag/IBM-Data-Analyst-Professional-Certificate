## About this Course
The third course in the program is an introduction to data visualization using Microsoft Excel and IBM Cognos Analytics. It goes over the different types of charts and appropriate use cases for them before moving on to the process of creating dashboards in Excel and Cognos Analytics.

The course has four modules:
-	Visualizing Data Using Spreadsheets
-	Creating Visualizations and Dashboards with Spreadsheets
-	Creating Visualizations and Dashboards with Cognos Analytics
-	Final Project
  
This was an informative course as I was introduced to IBM Cognos Analytics for my first time. It was relatively intuitive using Cognos so I didnâ€™t have much difficulty getting comfortable with the platform.

Some of the concepts taught in the course:
-	Types of charts in Excel
-	Tree maps, Scatter Charts and Histograms
-	Creating dashboards with Excel and Cognos

For the final course project, we were instructed to create visualizations with data based on a car dealership. The project was split into two parts. In the first part, we created individual charts in Excel based on given instructions. In the second part, we built a dashboard in Cognos covering the key metrics as instructed.

The final Excel file and the PDF file containing the Cognos dashboard are provided in this folder.
